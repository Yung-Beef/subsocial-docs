## Bounties üí∞
### Browser Extension to Resolve Subsocial Domains
- Subsocial allows people to register domains at https://polkaverse.com/dd
- Domains have several values attached to them, like spaces on the network, URLs of projects, etc. 
- We want you to create a browser extension that will resolve these domains from the browser‚Äôs search bar and navigate users directly to the linked website. 
- The extension should show the list of domains owned by an address, and let you save your address in order to see and explore the domains you own.
- It needs to mark whether a domain is available, or owned by a particular address. If available, then redirect to the domain buy page.
- You can use the Subsocial JS SDK and our docs to do it.
