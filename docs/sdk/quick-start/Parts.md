title: What Does Subsocial Consist Of?
---
Subsocial uses a few building blocks to enable social networking. A short summary of each is provided below.

### Profiles
A [profile](https://docs.subsocial.network/js-docs/js-sdk/interfaces/interfaces.profile.html) is an overview of an account's activity on Subsocial.
Profiles can have a profile picture and name, as well as a short bio. 
Below your profile overview is a collection of all of your posts, comments, reactions, and Spaces. You can view othersâ€™ profiles to see this information about them.

### Spaces
[Spaces](https://docs.subsocial.network/js-docs/js-sdk/interfaces/interfaces.space.html) are like directories or folders for posts.
All posts must be made inside of a Space. Think of a space like a subreddit, Facebook group, Twitter page, or Medium publication. 
Spaces have some profile features as well, such as Space pictures, names, and descriptions.

### Posts
[Posts](https://docs.subsocial.network/js-docs/js-sdk/interfaces/interfaces.post.html) 
are how to put content (such as text, audio, images, videos, or links) on Subsocial.
Posts are able to be commented on, reacted to, and shared. All posts must be made within a Space.

> :exclamation: [Comments](https://docs.subsocial.network/js-docs/js-sdk/interfaces/interfaces.comment.html) are also posts and have the same structure.

### Comments
[Comments](https://docs.subsocial.network/js-docs/js-sdk/interfaces/interfaces.comment.html) are replies to a post, and are visible below a post.
Comments are treated as individual posts, but they are nested under the parent post.

### Reactions
[Reactions](https://docs.subsocial.network/js-docs/js-sdk/interfaces/interfaces.reaction.html) are *upvoting* or *downvoting* a post (or comment).

### Follows
A follow is when a user chooses to see posts of profiles or spaces in their content feed. 
Users can follow other accounts/profiles as well as Spaces.
