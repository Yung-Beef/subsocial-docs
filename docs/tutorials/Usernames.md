### What are Subsocial usernames?
Subsocial usernames allow you to map a human-readable name to your Substrate account.

### What can I use Subsocial usernames for?
Subsocial usernames allow for recognizability and ease of use.

Simply compare **decentralized.sub** to **3pgFnoLz67beo6BBoMux2fxUQLFCbYAQxkQZqiobYNWjFfZV**. 
Which is easier to remember and share?

Subsocial usernames will be useable in any project that supports them, 
such as dapps built on Subsocial, wallets, and governance platforms.

PolkaVerse also supports Subsocial usernames, allowing you to set a username for your spaces. 
This makes the URL of your space more human friendly, such as https://polkaverse.com/@subsocial.

Sub.ID supports Subsocial usernames as well. If Alice buys **alice.sub**, 
then we can simply navigate to **sub.id/alice** to be taken to Alice's **Sub.ID** page.

Imagine creating a username once, and being able to use it on every app.

### How do Subsocial usernames work?
Usernames are stored on the Subsocial blockchain, creating a link between the username and the account that owns it.
This allows applications such as PolkaVerse to easily access this, 
allowing usernames to be used in place of long account addresses.

### How do I register a username?
You can register a username on [the registration page](https://polkaverse.com/dd).

### Will there be a minimum length for usernames?
Yes. Usernames from 6 to 63 characters long can be registered. Names with 5 characters or less will be reserved.

### When will reserved usernames be available?
Reserved usernames will be auctioned at a later date.

### Will my usernames expire?
Yes, if they are not renewed. Initially, usernames will last for 1 year, though we plan to add extension options later on. 
An advantage of expiring usernames is that it will prevent the common scenario of great usernames being taken by accounts that haven't been used in years.

### Can I buy and sell usernames?
For now, you can only register new usernames, but we are planning to allow trading in the future. 
In this way, Subsocial usernames will result in a username marketplace.Â 

### What are the future plans?
We have plans to work with many other projects to build great integrations for our username technology.
