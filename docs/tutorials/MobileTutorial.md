title: How To Use Subsocial On A Mobile Device
---
Using Subsocial from a mobile device is as simple as choosing a mobile-friendly Subsocial application, such as [Grill](https://grillapp.net/), 
and signing in with your Google or X account.

However, those methods are not fully decentralized, and may limit what actions you can take with your account. To unlock the full functionality of 
Subsocial, you will need to create a blockchain account using a mobile wallet application, like [Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/).

Mobile wallet apps usually have application browsers built-in, which you can use to navigate to whichever Subsocial application you are planning to use. 
You can then sign into the app with your blockchain account, and begin using it.
