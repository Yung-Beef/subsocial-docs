Creating an account with an email and password is the easiest way to get started on PolkaVerse.

First, click the Sign In button in the top right corner, select Sign in with email and then click Create account.

Simply enter your email and desired password, complete the captcha, and enter the email verification code.

On the next screen, please save your 12 word mnemonic phrase in a safe location while we prepare your account.

Finally, follow the short onboarding process to get yourself all set up, and you're all set to start using PolkaVerse!

If you want, you can follow along with our [short tutorial](/docs/tutorials/getting-started/polkaverse/intro) on how to use PolkaVerse.

Please note that, at the moment, using an email and password to sign in to PolkaVerse will slightly limit the functionality of your account.
To access all of the features, you will need to set up a browser wallet extension, like [Talisman](/docs/tutorials/).
