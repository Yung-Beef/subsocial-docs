[Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) is a web browser wallet extension that manages users’ private keys, 
and lets them sign transactions with their accounts. Unlike MetaMask, Polkadot.js does not allow users to create transactions 
with the extension (though you can sign transactions with the extension), it only manages the private keys. 
Transactions must be made from apps, such as the [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts).
 
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to set up the Polkadot.js extension and create an account to use Subsocial.
 
### Installation
