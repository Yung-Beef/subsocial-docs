title: Finding Content
---
The best way to find content is to go to the [homepage](https://polkaverse.com/?tab=feed) (which you can always get to by 
clicking on the PolkaVerse logo in the top left corner) and then click on the Posts tab. 
Content in the [Dotsama News](https://polkaverse.com/?tab=posts&type=suggested&date=week) category
is pulled from a curated list of spaces focused on the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. Alternatively, you can look at
all of the [latest posts](https://polkaverse.com/?tab=posts&type=latest&date=week).

Here you can find authors and spaces to follow. My hovering over an author's name, you can easily follow them.

Here you can follow some of the top spaces to start filling up your Feed with content. 
In addition to following spaces, you can also follow individual accounts. 
If you follow a space, you will see posts in that space, regardless of who made the post, and if you follow an account, 
you will see posts made by that account, regardless of which space they are posted in.
