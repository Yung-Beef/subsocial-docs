## PolkaVerse

The Subsocial team has built the first dapp running on the Subsocial network, PolkaVerse, as a proof-of-concept showing some possibilities of what apps on Subsocial can look like. PolkaVerse is focused on the Polkadot ecosystem and can be accessed [here](https://polkaverse.com/).

## Creating An Account
The easiest way to get started on PolkaVerse is to create an account using your email and a password.

As previously mentioned, if you have a Substrate account, then you already have a Subsocial account, and can sign in with the “Sign In” button located in the top right corner. 

If you don’t have an account, return to the [Creating An Account](/docs/tutorials/) section.
