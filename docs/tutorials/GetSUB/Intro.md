title: How Do I Get SUB?
---

Thanks to our partners at HydraDX and StellaSwap, SUB tokens are easily available to the public!

Here is a short summary of the two options:

- HydraDX is a Polkadot parachain with a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) that supports Polkadot wallets like [Talisman](https://www.talisman.xyz/), 
[SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/), and [Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/) (Mobile). 
If you are native to the Polkadot ecosystem, it may be your best choice.

- StellaSwap is a DEX built on Moonbeam, a Polkadot parachain that focuses on EVM technology. Other EVM chains include Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, 
Optimism, Arbitrum, etc. If you already have a wallet like Metamask, you can easily use Moonbeam and Stellaswap with your existing wallet.

If you are completely new to crypto and Web3, we recommend Talisman and HydraDX for getting SUB.

The liquidity on both exchanges may be different, resulting in differeng amounts of slippage when swapping to SUB. As a rule, lower slippage is better, 
so if you are aiming to acquire a lot of SUB, you may want to check both options to see which is better for you.

The next two pages have tutorials for getting SUB on both HydraDX and StellaSwap.
