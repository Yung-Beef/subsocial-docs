## Demand – who will want the Subsocial token?

Participants within the Subsocial ecosystem will need to acquire Subsocial tokens in order to
interact with the platform. The following list outlines typical groups of people who will want tokens.

- Users will be required to spend tokens to perform transactions, or to stake in order to get some free transactions everyday
- Content creators can spend tokens to get their content promoted
- People who want to participate in governance need tokens (this is to shape the development of the
  Subsocial ecosystem in a decentralized way)
- Users who want to get access to special content (private spaces)
- Collators need tokens to run a validator node for the Subsocial chain
- Users who wish to purchase space tokens will need Subsocial tokens

## Supply – who will be rewarded by the network?

There are certain participants within the network who perform vital functions to maintain the
integrity and availability of the network, therefore these participants will be rewarded with
Subsocial tokens. This will be a form of inflation paid out from the block reward.

- Collators (who produce blocks on the Subsocial chain)
- Treasury
- Participants in parachain crowdloans

We also considered whether the following actors within our ecosystem should be rewarded with
native Subsocial tokens, but may put the emphasis on these actors creating their own tokens on
Subsocial. This means that spaces within Subsocial will choose how to reward the
following:

- Content creators
- Publishers
- Influencers
- Moderators

## Token utility

Subsocial tokens have a number of different uses that we outline below. The main use for 
tokens will be using them to perform actions on the network. Please note that some of
these features are still in development.

- Performing transactions
- Monetizing content
  - Tipping
  - Subscriptions
  - Pay-Per-View
  - Selling or renting out your spaces or posts
- Deploying smart contracts
- Minting social tokens
- Voting in governance
