title: Token Distribution

## Initial Distribution

At the launch of the Subsocial blockchain we expect the tokens to be distributed in the following
manner.

- 10% - Private token sales (with 15-25% of this 10% should be unlocked at TGE, 2 years
  vesting).
- 25% - Team + advisors (no unlock at TGE, but there is vesting over 2 years).
- 65% - Ecosystem development:
  - 25% Kusama PLO
  - 15% development grants
  - 10% marketing
  - 5% content creators
  - 5% collators
  - 5% airdrops to existing communities: Polkadot, Kusama, Steem, Hive.

TGE = Token Generation Event. This is the event when tokens are initially created when the
main Subsocial network launches.

## Token Minting (post-genesis)

Once the network is live new blocks will be produced with an amount of new tokens that will be
given as a reward to important participants of the network. This is a form of token inflation.

In the first year, we are considering having no token inflation because the rewards for the key
participants will be included in the genesis block. These participants include the collators and
PLO participants.

We are planning to start with 10% inflation (of the total supply) from the second year onwards.
The parameters may be adjusted to reflect market conditions. We need to ensure that inflation
doesnâ€™t deter new people from joining the ecosystem, but is sufficient to reward certain
important participants from performing necessary functions (collators).

The total amount of inflation could be distributed in the following amounts over the year (these
numbers can be changed via governance):

- 25% for collators (and nominators?)
- 25% for treasury
- 25% for content creators
- 25% for reward pool of future PLOs
