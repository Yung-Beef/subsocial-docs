## Initial Distribution

At the Token Generation Event (TGE) we expect the tokens to be distributed in the following manner:

- 10% - Private token sales (with 24.5% of this 10% being unlocked at TGE, and the rest vesting monthly over 2 years)
- 25% - Team and advisors (vesting monthly over 2 years)
- 65% - Ecosystem development:
  - 25% Kusama Parachain Crowdloan (vesting monthly over 2 years)
  - 15% On-Chain Treasury (2% unlocked at TGE, vesting monthly over 24 months)
  - 10% Marketing (2% unlocked at TGE, vesting monthly over 24 months)
  - 5% content creators (vesting monthly over 12 months)
  - 5% collators (vesting monthly over 12 months)
  - 5% to existing communities: Polkadot, Kusama, Steem, Hive (starts vesting monthly in month 3, until 36 months after TGE)

The initial circulating supply will be 2.95 million tokens, with an initial total supply of 100 million tokens.

## Token Minting (post-genesis)

Once the network is live, each block produced will mint more tokens as a form of reward for 
important participants of the network. This will create inflation.

In the first year, we are considering having no token inflation because the rewards for the key
participants will be included in the genesis block. These participants include the collators and
parachain crowdloan participants.

We are planning to start with 10% inflation (of the total supply) from the second year onwards.
The parameters may be adjusted to reflect market conditions. We need to ensure that inflation
doesnâ€™t deter new people from joining the ecosystem, but is sufficient to reward certain
important participants, such as collators, from performing necessary functions.

The total amount of inflation could be distributed in the following amounts over the year (these
numbers can be changed via governance):

- 25% for collators and nominators (you can stake tokens to receive staking rewards, protecting you from inflation)
- 25% for the on-chain treasury
- 25% for content creators
- 25% for future parachain crowdloan rewards
