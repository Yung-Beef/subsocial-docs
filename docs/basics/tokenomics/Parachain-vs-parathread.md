title: Parachain vs Parathread

> A chain developed with Substrate can at different points in its lifetime assume one of three
states: an independent chain with a secured bridge, a parachain, or a parathread. ([source](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ru/learn-parathreads))

Subsocial has acquired one of Polkadot's parachain slots.

Should Subsocial fail to secure a parachain slot in the future, that chain will transition to a parathread.
