The Creator Staking system has two main objectives: grow the network, and improve curation. Here, we will look at how the system functions.

Heavy inspiration was taken from the Dapp Staking system implemented on Astar Network, aimed at incentivizing developers to build applications on the network. 
Content Staking incentivizes creators to make posts, and users to like posts that they think are high quality. This gives the network a signal about 
what content is high quality, and provides rewards for creators, which will help attract creators to Subsocial.

To participate in Content Staking, users need to lock at least 2,000 SUB [here](https://sub.id/creators). Once tokens are locked, a user can start liking posts 
on Subsocial, and they will receive rewards every week. Creators of the posts that a user likes will also receive rewards, thanking them for their great content.
The more tokens a user stakers, the higher their rewards will be.

Locked tokens will be subject to a roughly 7 day unlocking period. 
After the unlocking period, another transaction will be required to claim the unlocked the tokens.

## Rewards
Users with locked tokens will receive SUB rewards for each post or comment that they like in a day, up to a maximum of 10.

50% to likers, 50% to creators, maybe 5% dapp fee added in?

While Subsocial does not need staking for network validation (as it is secured by Polkadot), 
the implementation of Creator Staking will still positively benefit the network, by transferring token share from those are not participating in network growth, 
to those that are, as well as aiding in network curation and incentiving high quality creators.
