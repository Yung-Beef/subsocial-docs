The Creator Staking system has two main objectives: grow the network, and improve curation. Here, we will look at how the system functions.

Heavy inspiration was taken from the Dapp Staking system implemented on Astar Network, 
aimed at incentivizing developers to build applications on the network.
Creator Staking expands this idea to include creators of content and communities, as those are also very valuable to Subsocial.

Token holders can stake [here](https://sub.id/creators).

Holders of SUB tokens can to stake towards their favorite content, community, or application creators, in order to receive more tokens. 
Stakers will receive the same rewards regardless of who they stake to, effectively making this a vote, 
and improving curation by signaling to the network what is most popular with the userbase.

Creators of applications, content, and communities can register as Creators in the Creator Staking system, allowing token holders to stake towards them. 
Note that at launch, there will be a pre-selected list of 10 creators to stake towards. If you are a creator that would like to register, 
fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/aneosvJP1ntJ9Zrh6). In the future, creator registration will likely become permissionless, 
or take place through on-chain governance, though we are waiting to see how the system performs.

Creators will receive tokens based on how many SUB are staked towards them, compared to other creators. 
Of the tokens allocated to Creator Staking rewards, 50% will be distributed among stakers, and 50% will be distributed among creators.
As usual, the more tokens a user stakes, the more they can expect to receive in return, 
and a creator with one million SUB staked towards them will receive more rewards than a creator with only one thousand SUB staked towards them.

At launch, there will be 1,000,000 SUB allocated per month towards Creator Staking (500,000 split among creators and 500,000 split among stakers), 
which would represent 1.2% annual inflation to the token supply. However, as we test the system in the first few months, 
these tokens will be taken from the Subsocial treasury, instead of minting them.

Staked tokens will be subject to a unbonding period in order to unstake them, after which another transaction will need to be done to unlock them.

While Subsocial does not *need* staking, as it is secured by Polkadot, the implementation of Creator Staking will still positively benefit the network, 
and transfer token share from those are not participating in network growth, to those that are.
