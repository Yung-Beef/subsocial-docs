The building blocks of Subsocial are **Spaces**, **posts**, **comments**, **upvotes**, **downvotes**, and **follows**. They
will be familiar to everyone who has used any social media platform.

The best way to understand them is through comparison to familiar platforms:

**Spaces** are similar to:

- Blogs on Blogger,
- Publications on Medium,
- Accounts, pages, or groups on Facebook,
- Accounts on Twitter and Instagram,
- Channels on YouTube,
- Servers on Discord,
- Forums on Discourse,
- Subreddits on Reddit.

**Posts** are similar to:

- Posts on Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit,
- Articles on Medium,
- Tweets on Twitter
- Videos on Youtube.

**Comments** are simply posts that have a parent, and comments can be nested.

**Upvotes** and **downvotes** are reaction types, and **follows** allow for the creation of a social graph.

How about something more advanced? How can we recreate popular platforms for Web3
using Subsocial?

- **Airbnb** – apartment listings are spaces, while reviews are posts.
- **Quora** – a question is a post, answers are comments/replies.
- **Stack Overflow** –
  - Answers can be rewarded, e.g. by the question asker.
  - The distribution of payouts can also be split between what the question asker
and what the community finds to be the best answer.
- **Patreon/OnlyFans** – subscribing users can be granted access to a private space or private posts.

All posts and spaces are associated with public key pairs (accounts). This means all content
can be correctly attributed to the post's author and/or owner. The cryptography used is the same
as found in Polkadot. Subsocial supports multiple web browser extensions that allow for
easy key management in the browser, in addition to a solution for email and password sign-on.
