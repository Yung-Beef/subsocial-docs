Social Finance (SoFi) is our view of where blockchain technology can revolutionize payments for
social networks. At Subsocial, we are building a SoFi toolkit of decentralized financial primitives
that are optimized for social networking.

Not only is it important for creators to reap the benefits of their work, it is also important that the
community be able to freely decide who to promote and reward. However, SoFi takes those core principles and then sets about enabling
developer creativity to add advanced custom features.

With smart contract functionality on Subsocial, the community will be able to create their own
composable SoFi primitives, much like we can see in the DeFi space. The Subsocial team started
building primitives during [Hackusama](https://hackusama.devpost.com/project-gallery) such as tips, which are already available, 
and paid subscriptions. In the future we hope to add pay-per-view and NFTs.
