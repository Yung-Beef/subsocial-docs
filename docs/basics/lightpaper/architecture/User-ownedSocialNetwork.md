On current social networks we have very limited input on how the platform is governed partly
because we have no ownership of the platform. The biggest social media companies make
billions of dollars but donâ€™t share the profits with the users and only some fraction with the
content creators. Even as shareholders of the parent company, we are likely to have little input. 
For example, Meta does not ask their shareholders to vote on what content algorithms to use on Facebook.

On Subsocial, users are the owners of the network. Token holders can participate in the overall
governance of the Subsocial platform, but users can also participate in the governance of each
space where they are a member. Each space can be like a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous
Organization) where members can have ownership and help to steer the direction of a space. 
Space governance is optional, of course, but we believe many spaces will choose to
adopt this feature.

End-user applications can also implement some form of user-driven governance if they so choose.
