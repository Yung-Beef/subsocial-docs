The Subsocial treasury is a chain-level pool of tokens that can be spent on community proposals
to help further the project and ecosystem. It is envisioned that the treasury could sponsor things such as 
ongoing development of the Subsocial blockchain, creation of different web and mobile apps, alternative feed algorithms, marketing, and growing
the community.
