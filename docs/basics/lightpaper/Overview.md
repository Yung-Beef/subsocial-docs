Subsocial is an open platform that allows anyone to launch their own decentralized
censorship-resistant social networks and marketplaces, or easily add social features to existing applications. Subsocial will help you create your own
decentralized version of the popular sites we see today, such as Medium, Twitter, Reddit,
Instagram, Discourse, Patreon, OnlyFans and more, and can help set any type of dapp apart from the competition by offering a user-centric social experience.

Our software is built on the Substrate blockchain framework and uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized file storage.
This enables personalized news feeds and notifications, a transparent reputation system, full text
searching, and rich content formats, all without sacrificing SEO (search engine optimization).

Using Substrate also allows Subsocial to connect to the Polkadot network.
Polkadot is a next-generation blockchain protocol that unites an entire network of purpose-built
blockchains, allowing them to interoperate seamlessly at scale. Polkadot provides
cross-chain interactions as well as providing a shared security platform upon which Subsocial
can scale. Compared to other Web3 social projects, which have to trade connectivity for customizability, or vice versa, 
building on Polkadot gives Subsocial the best of both worlds: a custom blockchain built specifically for social use cases, 
and access to a thriving ecosystem without the use of bridges.

Subsocial is social media unbounded.
