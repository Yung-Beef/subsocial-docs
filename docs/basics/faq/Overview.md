## What is Subsocial?

Subsocial is a set of Substrate pallets that allows anyone to launch their own decentralized social network or community. 
Subsocial is **not** a decentralized social network, like Twitter or Facebook, but rather Subsocial is a platform for building social networks.

## Where does the name come from?

Subsocial will be the underlying architecture which the social networks of the future are built on top of. The prefix Sub refers to two things:
 - Subsocial will be the base layer supporting all of the social networks built on top of it
 - Subsocial is built on the Substrate technology

## Why does Subsocial need a parachain?

To learn about why Subsocial is launching as a parachain, please read 
[this article](https://app.subsocial.network/@subsocial/why-is-subsocial-bidding-for-a-parachain-slot-22225).

## How does Subsocial compare to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.?

Because Subsocial is not a social network, but a platform to build social networks on, this is an apples to oranges comparison.
However, social networks built on top of Subsocial (such as PolkaVerse) will have numerous advantages compared to Web2 social networks,
such as decentralization, censorship resistance, multiple avenues of decentralized monetization (no middle-men charging fees), 
and various other benefits of running on a blockchain.

## What is PolkaVerse?

[PolkaVerse](https://polkaverse.com/) is the first social network built on Subsocial, created by the Subsocial team. It allows use of all the major functionality
of the Subsocial network, such as creating spaces and posts.

## What are the benefits of building a community on Subsocial?

Due to some of the features listed above, Subsocial will allow you to create a much more vibrant and involved community. 
Utilizing social tokens and decentralized governance features, community members will be able to become participants in a way never before experienced.
Because Subsocial is a censorship resistant protocol, there is no central authority that can control your community. Instead, the community itself
can determine their own moderation and membership rules.

Additionally, any new communities launched on Subsocial will have access to content already on the network. This solves the chicken and egg problem
of whether users or content comes first.

## How can users benefit from using Subsocial?

On traditional social networks, most users never receive any compensation for the value they provide to the network. 
With social networks built on Subsocial, users will actually be able to capture the value they produce through various monetization methods,
like tipping, subscriptions, social tokens, selling ad space, and more. Additionally, Subsocial will feature an algorithm marketplace, 
letting users be in control of the content they see.

## I cannot get my Polkadot.js extension to connect to PolkaVerse. What is wrong?

If you are having issues connecting, try the below steps.
- Make sure your Polkadot.js account is set to "Allow use on any chain" 
- Make sure you have allowed app.subsocial.network to access your Polkadot.js
- Update your metadata
- Turn your AdBlock off
- Reload the page (only do this one time - please do not reload the page repeatedly).

## I am having trouble figuring out how to use Subsocial. What can I do?

If you have any questions, please reach out to us in our [Telegram](http://t.me/Subsocial) or [Discord](http://discord.gg/w2Rqy2M) chats.

## How is inappropriate or illegal content handled on Subsocial?

Subsocial has multiple ways to handle undesirable content. All posts must be made in spaces, 
and the owner(s) of a space can either moderate themselves, or appoint moderators, who can take care of stuff like that. 
Additionally, because Subsocial is made up of a separate back-end (the blockchain) and front-end (websites or mobile apps), 
the creators/operators of the front-end can moderate on their end. Here is an easy example: a website that runs on Subsocial that is just dedicated to cats 
would not show any content from the Subsocial blockchain that has to do with dogs.

For more information, check out [this post](https://app.subsocial.network/@subsocial/censorship-vs-moderation-how-does-subsocial-handle-these-31051).

## What are SUB tokens? What can I do with them?

SUB tokens are the native token of the Subsocial blockchain, and can be used to interact with the network.  
You can use your SUB tokens to create a space, make posts, and interact with others on Subsocial, 
by following them, or commenting and voting on their posts. Currently, you can also tip other users using your SUB tokens, 
and more monetization features will be added in the future.

You can also burn SUB to generate energy, allowing you to complete transations with reduced fees.

## What is energy?

Energy can be used to perform actions on the network, instead of SUB tokens. Energy can be created by burning SUB tokens.

## Can I transfer energy?

No. Energy is not a token, and it cannot be transferred.

## Can I give energy to other people or accounts?

Yes, but only by burning SUB. An account can burn SUB to create energy in a different account, allowing you to burn SUB and create the energy in your friend's account, for example.

## Can I convert energy back into SUB?

No.

## Is energy required to use Subsocial?

No, you can pay for transactions with SUB, but it will be cheaper to turn SUB into energy and pay for transactions with energy.

## Is there a way to get free tokens in order to use Subsocial?

No, but in the future applications may give energy to their users for free, allowing you to use Subsocial.

## How can I buy Subsocial tokens?

Currently it is not possible to buy Subsocial tokens.

## What is the ticker for Subsocial’s token?

The ticker of the token is **SUB**.

## What is the total token supply?

The total supply at launch was 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. Annual inflation will be 7.5%.

## Can I stake my tokens that are still locked in vesting?

Yes, you can stake tokens that have not vested yet.

## Is SUB an ERC20 token?

**No**. Subsocial has its own native token built on the Substrate blockchain framework. Our token uses the same technology as DOT, KSM, KAR, and other tokens of Substrate-based chains.

## Where can I see Subsocial's smart contracts?

There are no smart contracts for Subsocial, because it is built as a custom blockchain on top of the [Substrate](https://substrate.dev/) blockchain framework. 
The Subsocial blockchain is optimized for social networking types of operations, and has very low fees.

## Do you have a lightpaper?

[Subsocial Lightpaper](/docs/basics/)

## Where can I learn about Subsocial's tokenomics?

[Subsocial Tokenomics](/docs/basics/tokenomics/economics-vs-distribution)

## How do I start using Subsocial?

Install the [**Talisman**](https://talisman.xyz/) extension in your browser. This extension allows you to sign transactions for the Subsocial blockchain. 
It’s similar to MetaMask (a browser extension for Ethereum).

After Talisman is installed, create (or import) your account and then you can sign into [PolkaVerse](https://polkaverse.com/). 

To use PolkaVerse, you will need energy or SUB tokens.

## Can I use Subsocial on mobile devices?

You can read posts and comments from any mobile browser. To interact with Subsocial from a mobile device, 
check out our [Nova Wallet tutorial](docs/tutorials/mobile-tutorial).

## Is there an existential deposit on Subsocial?

Currently the existential deposit on the betanet is 0.1 SUB. This is subject to change in the future depending on the overall tokenomics of Subsocial.

## I have problems with the Polkadot{.js} extension. What should I do?

### My account is not displaying correctly

Double check that your extension is connected to the web dapp. If so, [refreshing the page](/docs/basics/faq/overview#i-reloaded-a-page-but-it-did-not-help) helps.

### I do not see new accounts from Polkadot.js extension

If you don’t see new Polkadot{.js} accounts on the web dapp in the top right corner, 
try to sign out, [reload the page](/docs/basics/faq/overview#i-reloaded-a-page-but-it-did-not-help), and sign back in.

### I reloaded a page, but it did not help

We recommend reloading the page with cache clean (Ctrl+F5 in most browsers).

### My transactions fail

In most cases, reloading a page of the Subsocial web dapp should solve your problem. 
If you are still having trouble with sending transactions (when following a space, creating a post or a comment, upvoting, etc.), 
report it to one of our [official chats](/docs/basics/faq/overview#what-are-the-official-social-links) (preferably main chat in English).
