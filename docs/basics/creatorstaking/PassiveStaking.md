Passive staking allows SUB holders to support their favorite creators with minimal action required.
Simply stake to your favorite creators, and you are free to forget about it for as long as you like.

You can start staking to your favorite creators and see the current reward APR on the [staking dashboard](https://sub.id/creators).

### Rewards

Of the tokens allocated to Passive Staking rewards, 66.7% will be distributed among stakers, and 33.3% will be distributed among creators.
Creators will receive tokens based on how many SUB are staked towards them, compared to other creators. 
As usual, the more tokens a user stakes, the more they can expect to receive in return, 
and a creator with one million SUB staked towards them will receive more rewards than a creator with only one thousand SUB staked towards them.

Subsocial currently has 1.58% inflation. 90% of this inflation will be allocated 
towards Creator Staking (the remaining 10% will go to the treasury).
The inflation rate and percentage of inflation that is allocated towards Creator Staking is subject to change.

Staked tokens will be subject to a roughly 7 day unbonding period in order to unstake them. 
After the unbonding period, another transaction will be required to fully unlock the tokens.
