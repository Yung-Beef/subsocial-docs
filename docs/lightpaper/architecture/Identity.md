title: Identity

On Subsocial we allow for the creation of a user profile. This is a single identity that can be used
in any community built on top of Subsocial. In the future, we believe this identity could be reused
on other parachains. 
Alternatively, users could import their identities from other parachains in the ecosystem that are focused on identity.

This is the likely solution for how to verify users (like the blue check mark on Twitter) on a decentralized network.
