title: Moderation
---

One topic that is important for the decentralized technology ecosystem is how moderation is
handled. Subsocial respects censorship resistance by not blocking content at the base level
(on-chain); however, we also understand the necessity of being able to moderate your personal
space in order to remove unrelated content, trolls, and spam, or otherwise moderate
inappropriate content.

A single set of moderation rules like Twitter is too rigid and pushes all users to adopt the same
perspectives in order to avoid being censored. Moderation per space means **“your space, your rules.”**
These rules are handled by the blockchain. In addition, it is possible to modify the UI (user interface) to allow
for greater control over the content displayed.

Different spaces can have different rules for moderation, but they all share the same blockchain.
Subsocial is the glue that binds all of the spaces together.
