Subsocial is far more than just a blogging platform with monetization features. It is a revolution in connecting
social media with decentralized finance. This is Social Finance, where social media meets DeFi.
To better explain how we differ from a simple blogging platform we must outline our architecture
at a high level.

We will briefly cover topics such as where content is published and how it can be monetized via
a myriad of methods that we are working on adding as soon as possible. This paper will also
cover how we handle reputation and allow for a multitude of reputation types.

Subsocial saves you the hassle of running your own social network blockchain. Multiple social
networks can run from the Subsocial chain which will provide shared networking effects. By
default the network is censorship-resistant, however, each community is able to set their own
rules for moderation.
