Subsocial allows communities to create their own space on top of the Subsocial chain, such that
all communities share the same underlying blockchain. This provides shared network effects:
users will be able to seamlessly join communities on any application connected to the Subsocial network 
(compared to traditional social media networks have separated content and user bases, such as Facebook and Twitter).
