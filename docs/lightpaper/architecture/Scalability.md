Subsocial allows communities to create their own space on top of the Subsocial chain, such that
all communities share the same underlying blockchain. This provides shared network effects:
users will be able to seamlessly join any community on any alternative clients for Subsocial 
(compared to traditional social media networks being seperated, such as Facebook and Twitter). In
addition, anyone with a Polkadot or Kusama address can easily join a Subsocial community.
