---

At its core our software is open source and modular in design. Subsocial allows for almost
complete tailoring to a communityâ€™s needs. This is hopefully obvious from the previous sections,
but it is worth having a summary of the many different ways in which our software can be used:

- Customize the UI with our [JS SDK](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-js),
- Deploy smart contracts for new methods of monetization,
- Inherit features from other spaces,
- Customizable per-space governance processes,
- Moderation options to suit audience tastes.
- Launch your chain using our open source code.

All code is open source and allows for customization of the front-end user interface to tailor it
to the needs of your community. Check out the Subsocial [JS SDK](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-js) for more details.
