At its core our software is open source and modular in design. Subsocial allows for almost
complete customization to meet a communityâ€™s needs. Here is a summary of some of the many different ways in which the Subsocial software can be used:

- Customize the UI with our [JS SDK](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-js)
- Deploy smart contracts for new methods of monetization
- Various moderation options
- Inherit features from other spaces
- Customizable per-space governance processes
- Create various applications and UIs to suit personal preference
- Launch your own chain using our open source code

All code is open source and allows for customization of the front-end user interface to tailor it
to the needs of your community. Check out the Subsocial [JS SDK](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-js) for more details.
