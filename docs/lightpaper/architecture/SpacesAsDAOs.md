title: Spaces as DAOs
---

The functionality provided by the Roles & Permissions modules is reminiscent of a DAO’s
characteristics. That is, a space on Subsocial could be run as a DAO. Subsocial allows multiple
owners (via multisignature wallets) to collectively control and monetize content.

Each space can have its own space token, therefore space ownership can be represented as a stake
in the space’s token. Similarly, each space could evolve by its own governance mechanisms,
using the space token as a governance token. As a result of this, each space could have its own treasury
that’s controlled by its token holders. A space could elect to sell ad space within the space, 
and split up the ad revenue proportionally among all holders of the space's token.

Governance can be used to modify space permissions and roles, elect moderators, or even
collectively decide how to block unwanted content.

In order to make trading easier between the space tokens, it would be possible to exchange
them for Subsocial tokens first.
