title: Social Tokens
---

Tokenize your Subsocial space with social tokens in order to help build and monetize your
space. Your followers can co-own your space and, if desired, participate in governance. A
co-owned space is essentially a DAO. This is something we will touch upon in a later section.

Tokens will either be minted from a smart contract using a bonding curve, or will be created by the owner of the space and listed for sale on a DEX.
We are still determining how this will work, but if the later option is chosen, we will either build our own DEX that is native to Subsocial, 
or build a way to use a DEX located on another chain.

Given the power of the Substrate ecosystem, it will be possible to trade your social tokens for DOT, KSM and
other parachain tokens, including stablecoins.
