title: Social Tokens
---

Tokenize your Subsocial space with social tokens in order to help build and monetize your
space. Your followers can co-own your space and, if desired, participate in governance. A
co-owned space is essentially a DAO. This is something we will touch upon in a later section.

A built-in AMM DEX (decentralized exchange) for social tokens, thatâ€™s native to Subsocial, will let users easily exchange
social tokens without having to worry about trying to trade their own tokens from one person to
another.

Given the power of the Substrate ecosystem, it will be possible to trade your social tokens for DOT, KSM and
other parachain tokens, including stablecoins.
