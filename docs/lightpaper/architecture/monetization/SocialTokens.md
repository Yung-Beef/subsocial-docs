title: Social Tokens

Tokenize your Subsocial space with social tokens in order to help build and monetize your
space. Your followers can co-own your space and, if desired, participate in governance. A
co-owned space is essentially a DAO. This is something we will touch upon in a later section.

We have a few ideas on how social tokens can be distributed, and are still thinking about the best ways to do it.

Given the power of the Substrate ecosystem, it will be possible to trade your social tokens for DOT, KSM and
other parachain tokens, including stablecoins.
