title: Subscriptions

One key feature that we haven’t seen with previous blockchain-powered blogging sites is the
inclusion of subscriptions. This is a huge feature of monetizing content that we see on popular
Web 2.0 platforms such as Patreon, SubStack, and OnlyFans.

The appearance of subscriptions into the ecosystem of content creation has allowed people to
start working independently and connect much closer with their fans. While YouTube adverts
offered something of a proxy before these sites came along, these sites went further in allowing
private content for different tiers of subscribers.

The biggest downside is that these platforms can block or remove content that they don’t like,
plus the creators trust the platform owners with their private content. How much private content
do the moderators of OnlyFans see? Removing points of trust is important for the
blockchain ecosystem.

The technical part of adding subscriptions to the Subsocial chain is easy; however, there is still
some research to be done with how to handle hosting for private content in a decentralized way
while preserving the privacy of creators.
