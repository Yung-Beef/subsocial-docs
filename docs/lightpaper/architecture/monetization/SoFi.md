title: "SoFi: When DeFi Meets Social Networking"
---

Social finance (SoFi) is our view of where blockchain technology can revolutionize payments for
social networks. At Subsocial, we are building a SoFi toolkit of decentralized financial primitives
that are optimized for social networking.

Not only is it important for creators to reap the benefit of their work, it is also important that the
community be able to freely decide who to promote and reward. That much should already be clear
from this paper. However, SoFi takes those core principles and then sets about enabling
developer creativity to add advanced custom features.

With smart contracts enabled on Subsocial, the community is able to create their own
composable SoFi primitives, much like we can see in the DeFi space. The Subsocial team started
building primitives during [Hackusama](https://hackusama.devpost.com/project-gallery) such as tips and paid subscriptions. Tips will be
available at launch. In the future we hope to add pay-per-view and NFTs.
