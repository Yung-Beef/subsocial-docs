Tips can be paid per post, per comment, or per space. Not only can post authors get paid, but
good comments can be rewarded as well.

Similar to tips on YouTube's Superchat – it is possible to use tips to highlight users’ comments.
Highlighted comments stand out compared to the free comments such that content creators will
notice those comments first. If the creators have thousands of comments per post as we see
with people like PewDiePie, highlighting will make a user’s comment stand out.

Tips will go straight to the account that you are tipping, and the tippee will receive the full value of the tip, as there are no middlemen to take a cut. 
Tips can be made with any token that exists on the Subsocial chain, including social tokens, and tokens from other parachains.
