title: Sell or rent your content
---

Blockchain technology enables true ownership: you own your content, so you should be able to
sell or re-sell your content. This dynamic isn’t really possible with web 2.0: your content may
include your name but it is typically not cryptographically signed nor stored on a public ledger.
Ownership in web 2.0 is less clear and requires legal contracts for enforcement.

With SubSocial it could be possible to sell content as NFTs as well as rent out your posts or spaces. You
retain the ownership and receive some income, while the renter receives traffic from all the
users who visit. Let’s provide an example:

:::note
If you wrote a popular post on some topic (e.g. e-commerce), and this post attracts
thousands of views per month, then it is feasible to assume that another space-owner
recognises that your post attracts a lot of traffic. On SubSocial, you would be able to rent
your post to another space for a specific time and be able to collect royalties for your
efforts.
