title: Posts and Spaces
---

The building blocks of Subsocial are **Spaces**, **posts**, **comments**, **upvotes**, **downvotes**, and **follows**. They
will be familiar to everyone who has used any social media platform.

The best way to understand them is through comparison to familiar platforms:

**Spaces** are similar to:

- Blogs on Blogger,
- Publications on Medium,
- Accounts, pages, or groups on Facebook,
- Accounts on Twitter and Instagram,
- Channels on YouTube,
- Servers on Discord,
- Forums on Discourse,
- Subreddits on Reddit.

**Posts** are similar to:

- Posts on Facebook, Instagram and Reddit,
- Articles on Medium,
- Tweets on Twitter
- Videos on Youtube.

How about something more advanced? How can we recreate popular platforms for Web3
using Subsocial?

- **Airbnb** – apartment listings are spaces, while reviews are posts.
- **Quora** – a question is a post, answers are comments/replies.
- **Stack Overflow** –
  - Answers can be rewarded, e.g. by the question asker.
  - The distribution of payouts can also be split between what the question asker
and what the community finds to be the best answer.
- **Patreon/OnlyFans** – subscribing users can be granted access to a private space or private posts.

All posts and spaces are associated with public key pairs (accounts). This means all content
can be correctly attributed to the post's author and/or owner. The cryptography used is the same
as found in Polkadot and Kusama. Subsocial supports multiple web browser wallet extensions that allow for
easy key management in the browser, or, in the future, an offline vault via Parity Signer.
