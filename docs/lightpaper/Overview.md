Subsocial is an open platform that allows anyone to launch their own decentralized
censorship-resistant social networks and marketplaces. Subsocial will help you create your own
decentralized version of the popular sites we see today, such as Medium, Twitter, Reddit,
Instagram, Discourse, Patreon, OnlyFans and more.

Our software is built on the Substrate blockchain framework and uses IPFS for decentralized file storage.
This enables personalized news feeds and notifications, a transparent reputation system, full text
searching, and rich content formats, all without sacrificing SEO (search engine optimization).

Using Substrate also allows Subsocial to connect to the Polkadot and Kusama networks.
Polkadot and Kusama are next-generation blockchain protocols that unite an entire network of purpose-built
blockchains, allowing them to interoperate seamlessly at scale. Polkadot and Kusama will provide
cross-chain interaction as well as providing a shared security platform upon which Subsocial
can scale whilst remaining secure.

Subsocial is social media unbounded.
