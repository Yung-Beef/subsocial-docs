title: Governance
---

In a previous section, we described how space owners have several options at their disposal for
governing their own space. We have tried to make space governance flexible enough to meet the owner's requirements.

In addition, there is also a layer of governance for the Subsocial chain as a whole. Just as we see for
Polkadot and Kusama, token holders of the Subsocial token will be able to vote on proposals that appear
on-chain.

The governance of the chain will decide how the chain upgrades and how the treasury money is
spent. Upgrades can be new modules that provide new functionality options for all spaces or
whether Subsocial should include integrations with other social networks or chains.
