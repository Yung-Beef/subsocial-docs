title: Marketplace for social networking algorithms
---

The content that makes up our feeds on social networking websites are controlled by unseen
algorithms that have a huge impact on our life. Billions of people use social networks operated 
by a few megacorporations, but no one can see how the algorithm works or choose a more appropriate 
algorithm that matches their tastes. This point is true across YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Medium and, 
we believe, all other Web 2.0 social platforms.

The curation of information is a sort of power that these companies hold over us. Their
algorithms are designed and constantly improved for their profits rather than the content 
that could be most valuable to us. A related problem is that of ad curation. There is a balance between
the amount of ads seen per user session, and irritation if too many ads are shown. Again, these
algorithms are not public.

We have an idea to solve that: an algorithm marketplace. This lets users choose
between different curation algorithms so that content in their UI can appear in a way that
best suits a userâ€™s preference. Should one algorithm prove not to work, it can then be replaced
by another.
