## Making A Comment
If you find a post you want to comment on, you can click the comment button.

Or, if you have clicked on the title of the post to open it fully, you can scroll to the bottom, 
where the comment tab is already open (this method will give you access to the full text editor).

Simply type your comment, hit the “Comment” button, and sign the transaction.
