## Setting Up Your Profile
Though you already have an account, you may want to add some details to it. By default, your profile name will simply be your Subsocial address.

To edit your profile, you can click on your account name in the top right corner to open the menu on the right side, and select “[Edit my profile](https://app.subsocial.network/accounts/edit)".

You are able to add a profile picture, set a profile name, and write a short bio.

To save your profile, hit the “Create new profile” button, and sign the transaction.

Congratulations, you now have a profile!
