Synthetic Concepts are concepts that are implemented not natively in the blockchain, but is implemented in the [`Subsocial GraqhQL`](/docs/develop/subsocial-graqhql).
Because of this, concepts in this section are only applicable when you are using Subsocial Graphql to fetch data.
These concepts are all just groupings of native concepts that you learn in previous sections, so you can easily implement common concepts in your own app with some customizability from the graphql queries.

Below are the list of Synthetic Events that are included in Subsocial Graphql:
1. [Activities](/docs/develop/concepts/synthetic/activities.md) - All social activity that you do in subsocial chain
1. [Feeds](/docs/develop/concepts/synthetic/feeds.md) - Posts from accounts and spaces that an account follow
1. [Notifications](/docs/develop/concepts/synthetic/notifications.md) - Social activities from other person related to you
