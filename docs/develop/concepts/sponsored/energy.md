Energy allows usage of the Subsocial network without tokens, and has a few key points and implications. Energy is not actually a token, and cannot be transferred between accounts, and transaction fees are lower when using energy. To create energy, tokens need to be burned, but the energy can be created in a different account than the one burning the tokens.

For more details, you can read it [here](https://docs.subsocial.network/docs/basics/lightpaper/architecture/energy).
