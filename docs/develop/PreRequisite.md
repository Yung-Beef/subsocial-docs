The docs assume some JavaScript and Frontend programming knowledge.

Explaining the concepts of JavaScript and CSS from scratch is beyond the scope of the docs. You don't need to be an expert in Frontend Development to try SubSocial SDK, but some basic knowledge will help you understand it better.

### Web Fundamentals

To build social products for people you may create a website or mobile app. And today most of common piece of technology used to do these include web fundamentals that are:

#### 1. HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language allows you to create structural layout for your webpages. It gives you the building blocks for making a cool website. The following concepts are important to understand:

- Basics of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)

We recommend watching the beginner friendly crash course for HTML & CSS by FreeCodeCamp:

CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox, is a CSS 3 web layout model. It is in the W3C's candidate recommendation stage. The flex layout allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending upon screen size.

#### 3. Vanilla Javascript

Javascript makes your webpages more intractive by adding logics that run on client side. You can use it to animate items on the webpage, do form validation, call API and get some response and much more.

Understanding the basics of Javascript is a must for every frontend developer, that's why we recommend the following video lecture on JS basics:

Frontend frameworks like React, Vue and Angular gives you features to build high performance web pages for the mordern web apps. We sugguest you to learn the following:

- Anyone framework from React / Vue / Angular
