xSocial is an experimental blockchain built to provide an environment for innovative Web3 social features before they are deployed on the Subsocial mainnet.

This blockchain functions as a standalone Substrate chain (instead of a parachain on Polkadot or Kusama), allowing it to have 2 second block times, 
and ensuring no serious damage can be caused by bugs.

Developers building on Subsocial can use xSocial to experiment with Subsocial's pallets in a safe environment. 
You can easily access xSocial from the polkadot.js apps page [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://xsocial.subsocial.network).

xSocial currently hosts the Grill.chat application, which needs speed due to the nature of messaging applications, 
though it will also be ported to the Subsocial mainnet in the future.
