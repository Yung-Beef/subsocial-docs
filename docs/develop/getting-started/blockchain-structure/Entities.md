**This section covers how spaces, posts, and reactions are related to each other.**

Subsocial uses a few building blocks to enable social networking. 

In order to have an understanding of the SDK it is not necessary to know the implementation of the substrate based pallets that compose Subsocial. 
However, understanding how these entities are structured and how their interaction takes place can help you build with the SDK.
